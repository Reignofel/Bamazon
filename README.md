Bamazon Store App

This App will allow all customers to access product data, make purchases, check stock, and inventory.

Customer

Customers can view all of the products in the Bamazon database and, if they so choose to, purchase as many products as they'd like (if they're in stock).

If a requested product does not have the requisite inventory, they will be notified of how many units (if still available) are in stock, and given the option to continue with the purchasing process but for a different amount of units.# Bamazon
